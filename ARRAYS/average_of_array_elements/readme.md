# 📊 Average of Array Elements in C++

## 📘 What is Average?

The **average** of an array means the **sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements**.

**Formula:**

Average = (Sum of Elements) / (Number of Elements)

**Example:**

If:

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Then:
- Sum = 150
- Number of elements = 5
- Average = 150 / 5 = 30

## 🛠️ Steps to Calculate Average

1. Declare the array and take user input.
2. Initialize sum = 0.
3. Use a for loop to calculate the sum.
4. Use the formula: average = sum / number_of_elements.
5. Print the result.

## 🧪 Sample Input & Output

Input:

Enter 5 elements:  
5  
10  
15

## 📌 Notes

- Use float or double to handle decimal values in average.
- Works with any array size — just replace 5 with your desired size.
