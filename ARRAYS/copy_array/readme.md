# ðŸ“‹ Copy an Array to Another Array

In this guide, we understand how to **copy elements of one array into another** using a simple loop-based approach.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, create a new array and copy all elements from the original array into it.

---

## ðŸ§  Logic & Approach

We traverse the original array and copy each element to the corresponding index in the new array.

### ðŸ”„ Steps:

1. Create a new array of the same size as the original.
2. Use a loop to iterate over each element of the original array.
3. For each index `i`, assign `newArray[i] = originalArray[i]`.

## âœ… Output Example

For an input array: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`  
After copying, the new array will be:

- **Copied array:** `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
