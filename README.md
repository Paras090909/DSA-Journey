This repository contains all the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions Iâ€™m solving, including:

ðŸ§© LeetCode problems

ðŸ“˜ Questions taught by my DSA teacher

Everything is organized topic-wise for easy navigation and consistency. Iâ€™ll keep updating it regularly as I progress.

You can also use this repo as a DSA roadmap â€” follow the sequence of topics and problems to build a strong foundation and improve your problem-solving skills step-by-step.
