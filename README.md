# 🧠 DSA Practice Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
Here, I’ve been consistently solving and uploading questions from platforms like **LeetCode** along with the **DSA problems taught in my classes**. This repo is structured **topic-wise**, so it’s not only my personal practice archive but also something **you can use as a DSA roadmap** 🛣️.
